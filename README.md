# Typed RRR

A *TypeScriptified* application that runs with the three big **R's**: React, Redux, React-Router.
Also throws in Styled Components for fun.

This project was created predominantly for using as a basis for a "real" project. Feel free to take
it and do with it as you wish for you own needs.

## Scripts

> [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is the recommended package manager for this project.

- `yarn install` ~ *Install dependencies*
- `yarn start` ~ *For local development*
- `yarn test` ~ *Run all tests once with coverage*

This project was bootstraped with Create React App, so you can always run `yarn eject` if you want
to (irreversibly) expose the underlying config files for advanced build configurations.

## Useful resources

I found these resources useful for setting up this project:
